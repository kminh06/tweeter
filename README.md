# Tweeter - Social Media App

This project is built using React and Firebase. The goal of this project is to build a Twitter clone, for Elon Musk. 

By building this project, I've:
- Learned intermediate React (context, hooks, components, ...)
- Learned and used Firebase (authentication, firestore, hosting)
- Honed and improved my skills in programming web applications

I've successfully built a Social Media Web 2.0 App.
